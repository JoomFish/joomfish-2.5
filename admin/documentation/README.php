Welcome to the Joom!Fish multi lingual extention

FIRST OF ALL. JOOM!FISH DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY AUTOMATIC TRANSLATION! IT'S A 
MANAGER FOR THE TRANSLATION PROCESS AND A MANUAL TRANSLATION 
CAPABILITIES OF JOOMLA!.


The Joom!Fish extention is a package of a translation manager, a language 
selection module, and bots for additional features in searching and 
translating database stored information on the fly. The idea of the Joom!Fish 
is to give you a tool that is enabling you to translate any dynamic information 
within your Joomla! CMS. The translation is based on a generic mapping between
the database tables and the information needed for rendering your content,
module or component output. It is in the responsibility of the 3rd Party
developer to provide the required configuration files for the translation but
generally there is no limitation in the structure or information you want to
make translatabe.


The key features of the fish are:
 * Possibility for an unlimited amount of languages
 * Possibility to MANUAL translate all dynamic information of your Joomla!
   or the additional components/modules within ONE database
 * Overview of the changed contents in the translation list
 * Capabilities of front end translation
 * Module for language selection
 * SearchBot for searches within translated contents
 
 
Please read the post installation and documentation carefully. We have
made the effort to include a starting tutorial as well as some valuable hints.

If you have further questions you are welcome to consult the project website
http://www.joomfish.net

Please understand that the Joom!Fish development team can not provide you any
support nor consulting without payment. The extension is provided as it is
and support is an additional service.
